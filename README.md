# New names
Choosing better names for scientific concepts, especially those with a human name prefixing them.

I find having intuitive names for concepts helps both with learning them, and for having an intuition when recalling them.

- Frequency transform = Fourier Transform
- Pileup Statistics = Bose-Einstein Statistics
    - Credit to Coltrane Faragher
- Two-state Statistics = Fermi-Dirac Statistics
    - Credit to Coltrane Faragher
- \_\_T ensembles (e.g., PVT-ensemble) = \_ canonical ensemble
    - Already suggested, not popularized
- Wrapability = Gaussian curvature
    - As in, a sphere is easy to wrap up - you even get extra paper when folding it (+), but for the inside of a torus, the paper will rip (-)
- TS-rectangle engine = Carnot engine
- Geometric Gravity = General Relativity
- Pre-processing dedispersion = Coherent dedispersion
    - The unchanged name is very bad in my opinion. The word coherent itself makes me forget what the meaning is
- Post-processing dedispersion = Incoherent dedispersion

# Non-descriptive names pending replacement

- Feynman diagrams
- Galois group
- Hilbert space
- Monster group
- Christoffel symbols
- Ricci tensor

# Examples of good names

- Thermodynamics
- Quantum Mechanics
- Fast Radio Burst
- Soft Gamma Repeater
- Cosmic string
- Surgery on the manifold
