# New names
Choosing better names for scientific concepts, especially those with a human name prefixing them.

I find having intuitive names for concepts helps both with learning them, and for having an intuition when recalling them. To suggest an addition, either submit a pull request or email me.

- Frequency transform = Fourier Transform
- Pileup Statistics = Bose-Einstein Statistics
    - Credit to Coltrane Faragher
- Two-state Statistics = Fermi-Dirac Statistics
    - Credit to Coltrane Faragher
    - Alternative: Antisocial statistics
- \_\_T ensembles (e.g., PVT-ensemble) = \_ canonical ensemble (e.g., Micro canonical ensemble)
    - Already suggested, not popularized
- Wrapability = Gaussian curvature
    - As in, a sphere is easy to wrap up - you even get extra paper when folding it (+), but for the inside of a torus, the paper will rip (-)
- Geometric Gravity = General Relativity
- Pre-processing dedispersion = Coherent dedispersion
    - The unchanged name is very bad in my opinion. The word coherent itself makes me forget what the meaning is
- Post-processing dedispersion = Incoherent dedispersion
- Memoryless Chain = Markov Chain
    - Credit to Alwin Mao
- Likelihood Sharpness = Fisher Information
    - The sharper the maximum likelihood peak with respect to a parameter, the higher the Fisher information.

# Non-descriptive names pending replacement

- Feynman diagrams
- Galois group
- Hilbert space
- Monster group
- Christoffel symbols
- Riemann, Ricci, Weyl, Einstein tensor, etc. (all of GR, really)
    - The only good one is the stress-energy tensor
- Carnot engine
- Bayesian statistics
- Cramer-Rao Bound

# Examples of good names

- Thermodynamics
- Quantum Mechanics
- Fast Radio Burst
- Soft Gamma Repeater
- Cosmic string
- Surgery on the manifold

# Use cases

If lecturing, you could teach with the better name, and include a dictionary so students can Google with the "bad name."

If using a name in a paper, consider writing something like the following: "...coherent dedispersion, which we will refer to as 'pre-processing dedispersion' in this paper,..." Obviously some names are broadly used in a field, like Bayesian statistics, so it may be best to only change the name of a subconcept (e.g., Bayesian information criterion) so you gradually chip away at the bad name.
